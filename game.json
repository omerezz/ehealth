You successfully analysed the clinical clues, interpreted multiple imaging modalities, and confirmed the diagnosis through histopathology.\n\nKey insights:\n• Elevated PSA and negative MRI/CT can still indicate cancer — functional imaging like PSMA PET can reveal what anatomical scans miss.\n• Biopsy remains the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis and grading tumor aggressiveness.\n• The Gleason score provides essential information about how differentiated and aggressive the tumor is.\n\nNext step:\nPrepare to discuss treatment strategies — weighing the benefits and side effects of different approaches to personalize patient care."
